Scaffolding Controller for CodeIgniter 2.X
===
[CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com) is one of the most powerful, flexible and secure PHP Frameworks. Since first version it had a great feature called `Scaffolding`, which unfortunately later was [deprected.](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/changelog.html)

This is based on it's original Scaffolding class, and as it was recommended, this tool must be used for __development only__. Deploying site with this controller can be very harmful for your project. So, use only, if you are lasy using ( or just don't like me ) tools such as [phpMyAdmin](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/) and etc. 

Usage:
---

* Download Archive from Github Repository and place `/assets/` and `/application/` into your root folder (`/application/` folder must beo verwritten). 
* Setup Database configuration in `/application/config/database.php` file
* Go to http://example.com/index.php/scaffolding or http://example.com/scaffolding, if you have [removed index.php file](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/urls.html)
