CodeIgniter 2 Scaffolding
===
[CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com) is one of the most powerfeul, flexible and secure PHP Frameworks. 
Since first version, it had a great feature called `Scaffolding`, which unfortunately later was [deprecated.](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/changelog.html)

This is based on it's original Scaffolding class, and as it was recommended, this tool must be used for __development only__. Deploying site with this controller can be very harmful for your application.

Usage:
---

* [Download Archive from Github Repository](https://github.com/Landish/CodeIgniter-2-Scaffolding/archive/master.zip) and place `/assets/` and `/application/` into your root folder (`/application/` folder must be overwritten). 
* Setup Database configuration in `/application/config/database.php` file
* Go to http://example.com/index.php/scaffolding ( or http://example.com/scaffolding, if you have [removed index.php file](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/urls.html) )
