===
[CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com) is one of the most powerful, flexible and secure PHP Frameworks. Since first version it had a great feature called Scaffolding, which unfortunately was [deprected.](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/changelog.html)

Usage:
---

* Download Archive from Github Repository and place /assets/ and /application/ into your root folder (/application/ folder must beoverwritten). 
* Setup Database configuration in /application/config/database.php file
* Go to http://example.com/index.php/scaffolding or http://example.com/scaffolding, if you have [removed index.php file](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/urls.html)
