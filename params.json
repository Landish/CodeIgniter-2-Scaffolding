  "body": "#CodeIgniter 2 Scaffolding\r\n\r\n[CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com) is one of the most powerfeul, flexible and secure PHP Frameworks. \r\nSince first version, it had a great feature called `Scaffolding`, which unfortunately later was [deprecated.](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/changelog.html)\r\n\r\nThis is based on it's original Scaffolding class, and as it was recommended, this tool must be used for __development only__. Deploying site with this controller can be very harmful for your application.\r\n\r\n#How to Use?\r\n\r\n* [Download Archive from Github Repository](https://github.com/Landish/CodeIgniter-2-Scaffolding/archive/master.zip)\r\n* Place `/assets/` and `/application/` into your root directory (Note: `/application/` folder must be overwritten). \r\n* Setup Database configuration in `/application/config/database.php` file\r\n* Go to http://example.com/index.php/scaffolding ( or http://example.com/scaffolding, if you have [removed index.php file](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/urls.html) )\r\n\r\n#How to Deploy?\r\n\r\nBefore you publish your application, it's recommended to remove those folders and only after that upload to server. \r\n```\r\n/assets/scaffolding/\r\n/application/controllers/scaffolding.php\r\n/application/views/scaffolding/\r\n/application/language/english/scaffolding_lang.php\r\n```\r\n\r\n#Demo\r\n* [Database Tables List](#database-tables-list)\r\n* [No Data in Database Table](#no-data-in-database-table)\r\n* [Add/Edit Form](#addedit-form)\r\n* [Delete Data from Database](#delete-data-from-database)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Database Tables List\r\n![](https://github.com/Landish/CodeIgniter-2-Scaffolding/raw/master/assets/scaffolding/images/data/tables-list.jpg)\r\n\r\n### No Data in Database Table\r\n![](https://github.com/Landish/CodeIgniter-2-Scaffolding/raw/master/assets/scaffolding/images/data/no-data.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Add/Edit Form\r\n![](https://github.com/Landish/CodeIgniter-2-Scaffolding/raw/master/assets/scaffolding/images/data/add-form.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Delete Data from Database\r\n![](https://github.com/Landish/CodeIgniter-2-Scaffolding/raw/master/assets/scaffolding/images/data/delete.jpg)\r\n",
